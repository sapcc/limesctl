# Release Guide

1. Ensure local `master` branch is up to date with `origin/master`.
2. Ensure all checks are passing: `make check`.
3. Update the [`CHANGELOG`](./CHANGELOG.md) as appropriate. Make sure that the format is
   consistent (especially the version heading).
4. Commit the updated changelog.
5. Create and push a new Git tag (`v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`). We follow [semantic
   versioning][semver] for our tags/releases. A [lightweight tag][lightweight-tags] is
   sufficient as GoReleaser will update the release description using the release notes
   generated by [release-info].
